* During my analysis of the 2 files provided, I discovered a few correlations within the data when it comes to school size, budget per student and the overall passing students in th ose schools.
    
    ^ Passing Grades 
        District schools are much larger than the Charter schools when it comes to student size. Just because they are bigger doesn't always mean better. It seems that the bigger the school, the less students are passing. The overall passing percentage drops dramatically when the school size gets over 2000 students. The more students per school, the less they are learning.

    ^ Budget
        Even though Charted schools have typically smaller budgets and pay less per student on average, the student seem to thrive there. The smaller class sizes and smaller budget don't seem to knock these kids off their learnign track. The best opportunity for passing would be in a Charter school with at least 1,000 students. These students seem to grasp the concepts and pass their classes at a higher level than other schools.
